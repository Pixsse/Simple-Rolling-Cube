## Rolling Cube Setup

If you want to create your own rolling cube, you can use the RollingCubePawn class. This class provides the foundational logic for controlling the rolling behavior, making it easy to customize and integrate your own cube into the project.

If you want to adjust the speed, rotation angle, or other rolling behaviors, you can modify the RollingCubeComponent. Simply click on the component within the RollingCubePawn class, and you'll find settings to customize the cube's movement and rotation to fit your needs.
